**Distributed Game Control**

This software allows a player to remotely interact with an online
video game. The defining feature of this software is the ability to
use an actual controller to enter input (instead of the usual chat input).
The expected use case would be to allow remote play of a game on a streaming
service such as Twitch or Mixer with a web browser and physical controller.

## Installation & Use

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` to the <samp>ddgc</samp> directory
3. Run `nmp install`
4. Run `nmp start`
5. Open a browser to <samp>localhost:3000</samp> (or your environment's
   <samp>PORT</samp>)
6. Click the buttons directly, tab to them and press a keyboard button,
   or plug in a controller and press the buttons

## Information

* Only one button press will be sent per second, as this system is
  intended for online games where visual feedback can take many seconds.
  Buttons can be pressed multiple times per second, but only the last
  button press before emitting to the server will count.
* There are two indicators for this one-second timer. The first is a
  literal second hand in the lower right corner of the screen. The other
  is an orange highlight that appears around the button that was successfully
  sent to the server.
* Up to five of the latest accepted button presses will be visible on the
  game screen at a time.
* As this system is intended for older, emulated games, analog buttons
  and directional controls will be considered binary (pressed or not).
  Additionally, all analog and digital directional controls are normalized
  to one set of cardinal directions.
